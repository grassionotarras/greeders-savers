# greeders-savers

This program is simulating savers(Dove's) and greeders(Hawk's).

# Bobs

If 2 savers meet then they share their food and have a 75% chance to reproduce another saver or a guardian(We will get into guardians later)
If a saver and a greeder meet then the greeder steals their food having 100% chance to reproduce another greeder or a gangster while saver has 0
If a guardian meets a greeder then it will erase the greeder while having a chance to die. Guardians have 1 in 10 chance to replace a saver.
If a guardian meets a guardian nothing happens. Same for gangster for gangster.
If a gangster meets a guardian then they both die. Gangsters have 1 in 10 chance to replace a greeder when reproduction.
If a gangster meets a saver then the gangster has a 100% chance to reproduce.

# Additional effects

There are a few extra effects like if there is more savers than greeders then there will be a saver, or the greed burnout. 

# Additional info

Gangsters and Guardians were mainly added to make the program a tiny bit more complex. It is not very balanced though since gangsters destroy the savers so anyone could change some of the numbers, it shouldn't be too hard to understand how the program works since most of the stuff is commented.
